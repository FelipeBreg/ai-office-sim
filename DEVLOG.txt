  packages/eslint-config:
    package.json, base.js, next.js, node.js

REVIEW — ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED BEFORE COMMIT:
  CRITICAL (3):
    1. .eslintrc.js used CJS syntax (module.exports) in ESM packages ("type":"module")
       → Renamed all 7 files to .eslintrc.cjs
    2. Font-family in globals.css used literal 'IBM Plex Mono' instead of CSS var
       → Changed to var(--font-family-mono) referencing var(--font-mono) from next/font
    3. Missing --font-family-mono in @theme block, so Tailwind font-mono utility broken
       → Added --font-family-mono to @theme

  MEDIUM (6):
    4. next.config.js and postcss.config.js used ESM export without "type":"module"
       → Renamed both to .mjs
    5. --spacing-* tokens in wrong Tailwind v4 namespace
       → Moved to --width-* and --height-* namespaces
    6. Duplicate bullmq + ioredis in both worker and queue packages
       → Removed from worker, consumed through @ai-office/queue only
    7. 26 CSS tokens instead of spec's 24 (duplicate risk/status colors)
       → Removed 3 duplicate risk tokens, kept only --color-risk-critical
    8. Hardcoded lang="pt-BR" in layout (will be dynamic with i18n)
       → Noted for P0-8 fix
    9. Non-null assertion (!) on DATABASE_URL in drizzle.config.ts
       → Added runtime check with clear error message

  MINOR (3):
    10. Missing explicit outputs:[] in turbo lint/typecheck/test tasks → Added
    11. Missing eslint-config-next peer dependency → Added as optional
    12. Aggressive * { border-radius: 0 !important } → Replaced with --radius-* tokens

VERIFICATION:
  - pnpm install: zero errors across 11 workspaces
  - turbo typecheck: 8/8 packages pass, zero type errors
  - Design system: 24 CSS tokens confirmed

COMMIT #2 — Epic P0-2: PostgreSQL & Drizzle ORM Setup
================================================================================
Hash:     12b302d05673b6c166451fc94e6c819216b31b8a
Date:     2026-02-24 17:56:18 -0300
Tasks:    P0-2.1 through P0-2.9 (9 tasks; P0-2.10 Supabase RLS deferred to staging)
================================================================================

WHAT WAS BUILT:
  15 database tables across 10 schema files:
    - organizations: uuid PK, name, slug (unique), clerk_org_id, plan enum
    - users: uuid PK, clerk_user_id (unique), email, name, locale, role enum, org FK
    - projects: uuid PK, org FK, name, slug, color, composite unique (org_id, slug)
    - agents: uuid PK, project FK, name, archetype/status/trigger enums, config jsonb,
              tools text[], system prompts (EN+PT-BR), unique (project_id, slug)
    - agent_memory: uuid PK, agent FK, project FK, key/value, embedding vector(1536)
    - action_logs: uuid PK, project FK, agent FK, session_id, action_type, tokens,
                   cost, duration, composite index (project_id, created_at)
    - approvals: uuid PK, project FK, agent FK, action_log FK, risk_level enum,
                 status enum, reviewed_by FK (nullable)
    - workflows: uuid PK, project FK, name, definition jsonb (React Flow graph)
    - workflow_runs: uuid PK, workflow FK, project FK, status enum
    - workflow_node_runs: uuid PK, run FK, project FK, node_id, agent FK
    - documents: uuid PK, project FK, title, source_type enum, content
    - document_chunks: uuid PK, document FK, project FK, embedding vector(1536)
    - strategies: uuid PK, project FK, type enum, user_draft, ai_refined, status enum
    - strategy_kpis: uuid PK, strategy FK, project FK, current/target values
    - strategy_learnings: uuid PK, strategy FK, project FK, agent FK, insight

  Supporting files:
    - custom-types.ts: pgvector vector(1536) custom Drizzle type
    - enums.ts: 16 PostgreSQL enums (plan, user_role, locale, agent_archetype,
                agent_status, trigger_type, memory_scope, action_status, risk_level,
                approval_status, workflow_run_status, document_source_type,
                strategy_type, strategy_status, kpi_direction)
    - seed.ts: Idempotent seed script creating 1 org, 1 user, 1 project,
               3 agents (Support/Sales/Data Analyst with PT-BR prompts),
               5 action log entries

FILES CREATED (12 new, 1 modified):
  packages/db/src/schema/:
    custom-types.ts, enums.ts, organizations.ts, users.ts, projects.ts,
    agents.ts, action-logs.ts, approvals.ts, workflows.ts, documents.ts,
    strategies.ts
  packages/db/src/:
    seed.ts
  Modified:
    packages/db/src/schema/index.ts (barrel export updated)

REVIEW — ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED BEFORE COMMIT:
  CRITICAL (4):
    1. projects.slug had no unique constraint → seed onConflictDoNothing silently failed
       → Added composite unique index (org_id, slug)
    2. Seed project used onConflictDoNothing (returns empty on conflict)
       → Changed to onConflictDoUpdate so .returning() always returns the row
    3. Agents inserted with plain insert (no upsert, duplicates on re-run)
       → Added unique (project_id, slug) + seed now uses onConflictDoUpdate
    4. Action logs inserted with plain insert (duplicates on re-run)
       → Added guard: check existing logs for project before inserting

  MEDIUM (3):
    5. workflow_node_runs missing project_id FK (every child table needs it for RLS)
       → Added project_id FK with cascade delete
    6. strategy_kpis missing createdAt timestamp (every other table has it)
       → Added createdAt with defaultNow()
    7. Redundant org_slug_idx index (slug already has .unique() which creates index)
       → Removed the redundant explicit index

  MINOR (1):
    8. users table missing updatedAt (mutable fields: role, locale, timezone)
       → Added updatedAt with $onUpdate

  ALSO FIXED DURING CODING (before review):
    - Missing jsonb import in approvals.ts
    - vector custom type fromDriver param typed as string instead of unknown
    - Duplicate vector type definition in agents.ts and documents.ts
      → Extracted to shared custom-types.ts

VERIFICATION:
  - turbo typecheck: 8/8 packages pass, zero type errors
  - Table count: 15 confirmed
  - Seed idempotency: org+user use onConflictDoUpdate, project uses onConflictDoUpdate
    with composite target, agents use onConflictDoUpdate, logs guarded with SELECT

COMMIT #3 — Epic P0-3: Redis & BullMQ Queue System
================================================================================
Hash:     f528052
Date:     2026-02-24 ~18:20 -0300
Tasks:    P0-3.1 through P0-3.5 (5 tasks)
================================================================================

WHAT WAS BUILT:
  packages/queue/src/:
    - connection.ts: BullMQ connection options factory (parses REDIS_URL,
      includes db index, enableReadyCheck, maxRetriesPerRequest)
    - jobs.ts: 7 Zod schemas for typed job payloads (AgentExecution,
      AgentScheduled, ToolExecution, EmbeddingGeneration, Notification,
      Analytics, Cleanup)
    - queues.ts: 7 BullMQ queue instances as lazy singletons with
      per-queue retry/backoff config + removeOnFail:false (dead letter)
    - index.ts: Barrel export (QUEUE_NAMES, getters, schemas, types)

  apps/worker/src/:
    - workers/create-worker.ts: Generic typed worker factory with
      Zod validation, error/completed/failed/stalled handlers
    - workers/*.worker.ts: 7 stub workers using factory pattern
    - index.ts: Express server + Bull Board (dev) + health endpoint
      + graceful shutdown with 30s timeout + global error handlers

  Queue architecture (7 queues):
    agent-execution:   concurrency=5,  retry=3x 30s exp backoff
    agent-scheduled:   concurrency=3,  retry=3x 30s exp backoff
    tool-execution:    concurrency=10, retry=5x 10s exp backoff
    embedding-generation: concurrency=3, retry=3x 15s exp backoff
    notification:      concurrency=5,  retry=5x 60s exp backoff
    analytics:         concurrency=1,  retry=3x 60s exp backoff
    cleanup:           concurrency=1,  retry=2x 120s exp backoff

FILES CREATED (11 new, 4 modified):
  New:
    packages/queue/src/connection.ts, jobs.ts, queues.ts
    apps/worker/src/workers/create-worker.ts
    apps/worker/src/workers/{agent-execution,agent-scheduled,tool-execution,
      embedding-generation,notification,analytics,cleanup}.worker.ts
    apps/worker/src/workers/index.ts
  Modified:
    packages/queue/src/index.ts, packages/queue/package.json
    apps/worker/src/index.ts, apps/worker/package.json, pnpm-lock.yaml

REVIEW — ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED BEFORE COMMIT:
  CRITICAL (3):
    1. Workers never validated job payloads with Zod at runtime
       → Created createTypedWorker factory with schema.parse() on every job
    2. getConnectionOptions() missing enableReadyCheck:false (race on reconnect)
       → Added to connection options
    3. createRedisConnection() was a footgun (unused but exported, leaked connections)
       → Removed entirely, only getConnectionOptions() remains

  HIGH (2):
    4. Graceful shutdown could hang indefinitely (no timeout)
       → Added 30s hard-exit timeout + server.closeAllConnections()
    5. getConnectionOptions() dropped Redis db index from URL path
       → Added db: Number(parsed.pathname.slice(1)) parsing

  MEDIUM (1):
    6. No error event handlers on workers (could crash process)
       → Added worker.on('error') in the factory

  LOW (3) — also fixed:
    7. No unhandledRejection/uncaughtException handlers → Added
    8. 7 worker files were 250+ lines of boilerplate → Extracted factory (30 lines)
    9. Unused socket.io dep in worker → Removed (will add in P0-9)
    10. Unused @ai-office/shared dep in queue package → Removed

  ALSO FIXED DURING CODING (before review):
    - Missing zod dep in packages/queue/package.json
    - ioredis import: default vs named export issue with NodeNext resolution
      → Used named import { Redis } from 'ioredis'
    - bull-board adapter import path: .js extension not in exports map
      → Removed .js suffix
    - bullmq needed as direct dep in worker (Worker class import)

VERIFICATION:
  - turbo typecheck --force: 8/8 packages pass, zero type errors
  - pnpm install: zero errors across all workspaces
  - All 7 queues match roadmap concurrency and retry specs
  - All 7 workers validate payloads with Zod before processing


================================================================================
COMMIT #5 — Epic P0-4: CI/CD Pipeline — GitHub Actions, Vercel, Railway
================================================================================
Hash:     bec2cb2
Date:     2026-02-24 ~19:30 -0300
Tasks:    P0-4.1 through P0-4.5 (5 tasks)
================================================================================

WHAT WAS BUILT:
  .github/workflows/ci.yml:
    - Triggers: pull_request + push to main/develop + workflow_call (reusable)
    - Node.js matrix: 20, 22
    - Services: pgvector/pgvector:pg16 + redis:7-alpine with health checks
    - Steps: checkout → pnpm 9 → Node.js → install → lint → typecheck → test → build
    - Concurrency: cancel-in-progress per ref
    - timeout-minutes: 15

  .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml:
    - Trigger: push to develop
    - Job graph: ci (gate) → migrate-db → deploy-web + deploy-worker (parallel)
    - cancel-in-progress: false (prevents partial deploys)
    - Web: Vercel (preview environment)
    - Worker: Railway CLI (staging environment)

  .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml:
    - Trigger: push to main
    - Job graph: ci (gate) → migrate-db → deploy-web + deploy-worker (parallel)
    - cancel-in-progress: false
    - Web: Vercel (production environment, --prod flag)
    - Worker: Railway CLI (production environment)

  vercel.json:
    - Framework: nextjs
    - installCommand: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
    - buildCommand: pnpm turbo build --filter=web
    - No rootDirectory (runs from repo root for monorepo compat)

  apps/worker/Dockerfile:
    - Multi-stage build (builder + runner)
    - Base: node:20-alpine
    - Copies ALL workspace package.json files (pnpm lockfile requirement)
    - Build: pnpm turbo build --filter=worker...
    - Prune: pnpm prune --prod (in builder, before copy to runner)
    - Non-root user: worker (uid 1001)
    - HEALTHCHECK: wget http://localhost:4000/health every 30s
    - Exposes port 4000

  .dockerignore:
    - Excludes: node_modules, .git, .github, .turbo, .next, .env*, *.md,
      dist, coverage, .vscode, .idea
    - Allows: .env.example

FILES CREATED (6 new):
  .github/workflows/ci.yml
  .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
  .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml
  vercel.json
  apps/worker/Dockerfile
  .dockerignore

REVIEW — ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED BEFORE COMMIT:
  CRITICAL (3):
    1. ci.yml missing workflow_call trigger → production deploy referenced it as
       reusable workflow but it had no workflow_call trigger → Added
    2. Dockerfile missing packages/api and apps/web package.json → pnpm
       --frozen-lockfile fails when workspace packages are absent → Added ALL
       workspace package.json files
    3. deploy-web ran in parallel with migrate-db (web could deploy before
       migrations) → Changed deploy-web needs to [ci, migrate-db]

  HIGH (5):
    4. Staging deploy had no CI gate → Added ci job using workflow_call
    5. Staging deploy was missing database migrations → Added migrate-db job
    6. Dockerfile ran as root → Added non-root user (worker, uid 1001)
    7. Dockerfile copied full node_modules with devDeps to runner → Added
       pnpm prune --prod in builder stage before copy
    8. vercel.json buildCommand used fragile "cd ../.. &&" path → Changed to
       root-relative "pnpm turbo build --filter=web", removed rootDirectory

  MEDIUM (2):
    9. Staging cancel-in-progress:true could leave partial deploys → Changed
       to false (matches production)
    10. No timeout on CI job (default 6h) → Added timeout-minutes: 15

VERIFICATION:
  - turbo typecheck --force: 8/8 packages pass, zero type errors
  - All 3 workflows have correct job dependency graphs
  - Dockerfile includes all 10 workspace package.json files
  - Non-root user configured in runner stage


================================================================================
COMMIT #7 — Epic P0-5: Authentication & Multi-Tenancy (Clerk)
================================================================================
Hash:     c424e05
Date:     2026-02-24 ~20:15 -0300
Tasks:    P0-5.1 through P0-5.5 (5 tasks)
================================================================================

WHAT WAS BUILT:
  apps/web/src/middleware.ts:
    - Clerk middleware with clerkMiddleware() + createRouteMatcher
    - Public routes: /, /sign-in, /sign-up, /:locale/sign-in, /:locale/sign-up,
      /api/webhooks
    - All other routes require authentication

  apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx:
    - Wrapped with ClerkProvider
    - IBM Plex Mono font, dark theme globals.css

  apps/web/src/app/(public)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx:
    - Clerk SignIn component with dark theme appearance overrides

  apps/web/src/app/(public)/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx:
    - Clerk SignUp component with dark theme appearance overrides

  apps/web/src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts:
    - Svix webhook signature verification (uses raw body text)
    - user.created: creates personal org (slug: personal-{clerkId}),
      default project, user (idempotent with onConflictDoUpdate)
    - user.updated: syncs email, name, avatar
    - user.deleted: removes user + cleans up orphaned org if no members
    - organization.created: upserts org by clerkOrgId, creates default project
    - organizationMembership.created: updates user orgId + maps Clerk role
      (org:admin→admin, org:member→viewer)

  apps/web/src/stores/project-store.ts:
    - Zustand store with persist middleware (skipHydration for SSR)
    - State: currentOrgId, currentProjectId, userRole, organizations, projects
    - Selectors: useActiveProject(), useProjects(), useUserRole(), useActiveOrg()
    - Only currentOrgId + currentProjectId persisted to localStorage

  packages/api/src/trpc.ts:
    - createTRPCContext: accepts clerkUserId + projectId, looks up user/org/project
    - publicProcedure: no auth required
    - protectedProcedure: requires auth + org (narrows both to non-null)
    - projectProcedure: requires auth + org + project, sets RLS session var
      via parameterized SQL: set_config('app.current_project_id', $1, true)
    - requireRole(minimumRole): middleware factory with hierarchy
      viewer(0) < manager(1) < admin(2) < owner(3)
    - adminProcedure: projectProcedure + requireRole('admin')
    - ownerProcedure: projectProcedure + requireRole('owner')

FILES CREATED (5 new, 7 modified):
  New:
    apps/web/src/middleware.ts
    apps/web/src/app/(public)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx
    apps/web/src/app/(public)/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx
    apps/web/src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts
    apps/web/src/stores/project-store.ts
  Modified:
    apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx (added ClerkProvider)
    apps/web/package.json (added @clerk/nextjs, svix, drizzle-orm)
    packages/api/src/trpc.ts (full rewrite with auth context)
    packages/api/src/index.ts (new exports)
    packages/api/package.json (added drizzle-orm, @types/node)
    .env.example (added CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET, after sign-in/up URLs)
    pnpm-lock.yaml

REVIEW — ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED BEFORE COMMIT:
  CRITICAL (1):
    1. SQL injection in RLS set_config via string interpolation
       → Changed to parameterized query using drizzle-orm sql tag

  HIGH (4):
    2. Webhook body re-serialization (JSON.parse→JSON.stringify) could break
       svix signature verification → Changed to req.text() for raw body
    3. user.created handler not idempotent — plain INSERT without conflict
       handling caused failures on webhook replay → Added onConflictDoUpdate
    4. organization.created used clerkOrgId as conflict target but slug
       collision would throw unhandled error → Wrapped in try/catch
    5. organizationMembership.created did not map Clerk role, kept old role
       (privilege escalation risk) → Added role mapping (org:admin→admin,
       org:member→viewer)

  MEDIUM (5):
    6. Webhook threw raw Error on missing CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET → Changed to
       console.error + HTTP 500 response
    7. Org slug from email prefix could collide across domains → Changed to
       personal-{clerkId} format
    8. Zustand persist caused SSR hydration mismatch → Added skipHydration:true
    9. Middleware public routes didn't account for locale-prefixed paths
       → Added /:locale/sign-in and /:locale/sign-up patterns
    10. enforceAuth middleware did not narrow org to non-null → Added org
        null check with INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR

  ALSO FIXED DURING CODING:
    - Missing @types/node in packages/api (needed for process.env in db client)
    - Missing drizzle-orm in web app (needed for eq() in webhook handler)
    - undici-types inference error on POST handler → Added explicit
      Promise<Response> return type
    - Role mapping type mismatch (string vs enum) → Used typed roleMap
      with UserRole type alias

VERIFICATION:
  - turbo typecheck --force: 8/8 packages pass, zero type errors
  - Webhook handler fully idempotent for all 5 event types
  - RLS set_config uses parameterized SQL (no injection risk)
  - Role hierarchy: viewer(0) < manager(1) < admin(2) < owner(3)

COMMIT #9 — Epic P0-6: LLM Observability (Helicone + Sentry)
================================================================================
Hash:     2e78b43
Date:     2026-02-24 ~21:00 -0300
Tasks:    P0-6.1 through P0-6.4 (4 tasks)
================================================================================

WHAT WAS BUILT:
  packages/ai/src/client.ts:
    - createAnthropicClient(): routes through Helicone proxy with custom
      properties (ProjectId, AgentId, SessionId, AgentName)
    - createDirectClient(): cached singleton for direct Anthropic API
    - getApiKey(): validates ANTHROPIC_API_KEY with clear error message
    - Auto-falls back to direct API when HELICONE_API_KEY is unset

  packages/ai/src/engine/llm.ts:
    - callLLM() wrapper around messages.create() with:
      - Helicone proxy with 5s timeout (HELICONE_TIMEOUT_MS)
      - Fallback to direct API on APIConnectionError or 5xx (typed detection)
      - Token tracking: input_tokens, output_tokens, total
      - Cost calculation from MODEL_PRICING table (warns on unknown models)
      - Latency measurement via performance.now()
      - action_logs persistence (non-blocking: DB failure doesn't discard response)

    packages/ai/package.json (added drizzle-orm, @types/node)
    packages/db/src/index.ts (drizzle-orm re-exports)

    .env.example (added SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN, SENTRY_ORG, SENTRY_PROJECT)
    pnpm-lock.yaml

REVIEW — ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED BEFORE COMMIT:
  CRITICAL (4):
    1. Fallback detection used includes('5') — matched any string with digit 5
       → Changed to APIConnectionError/APIError(status>=500) typed detection
    2. Missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY silently passed undefined to SDK
       → Added getApiKey() with clear error message
    3. DB insert failure in error path swallowed original LLM error
       → Wrapped error-path DB insert in try/catch
    4. DB insert failure in success path discarded valid LLM response
       → Wrapped success-path insert in try/catch, returns result regardless

  HIGH (5):
    5. New Anthropic client created per call (connection pool churn)
       → Cached direct client as singleton via createDirectClient()
    6. costUsd.toFixed(6) introduced floating-point rounding before Postgres
       → Changed to String(costUsd), let Postgres handle numeric(10,6)
    7. Non-null assertion on actionLog!.id unsafe → Used actionLog?.id ?? null
    8. Inconsistent Sentry DSN env vars (SENTRY_DSN vs NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN)
       → Unified on NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN everywhere
    9. Sentry.captureException called without init when DSN unset
       → Always call Sentry.init() (no-op without DSN)

  MEDIUM (4):
    10. LLMCallError type exported but never used (dead code) → Removed
    11. HELICONE_TIMEOUT_MS defined but never applied → Now passed to SDK
    12. Hardcoded pricing with silent fallback → Added console.warn for unknown models
    13. replaysOnErrorSampleRate without replayIntegration → Removed replay config

  ALSO FIXED DURING CODING:
    - pnpm drizzle-orm duplicate instance (web vs db) → Re-exported from @ai-office/db
    - Duplicate import lines in llm.ts → Combined to single import
    - Removed unused SENTRY_DSN from .env.example, added SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN/ORG/PROJECT

VERIFICATION:
  - turbo typecheck --force: 8/8 packages pass, zero type errors
  - Fallback uses typed SDK error classes (no string matching)
  - DB logging is non-blocking in both error and success paths
  - Direct client cached as singleton

COMMIT #11 — Epic P0-7: First Agent Execution Loop
================================================================================
Hash:     fb7a4f4
Date:     2026-02-24 ~22:00 -0300
Tasks:    P0-7.1 through P0-7.6 (6 tasks)
================================================================================

WHAT WAS BUILT:
  packages/ai/src/engine/types.ts:
    - AgentSession: sessionId, agentId, projectId, startedAt, actionCount,
      totalTokens, totalCostUsd, status, abortReason
    - AgentContext: agent config, systemPrompt, tools: ToolDefinition[],
      memory, conversationHistory, triggerPayload
    - ToolDefinition: name, description, inputSchema (Zod), requiresApproval,
      execute(input, context)
    - ToolExecutionContext: agentId, projectId, sessionId
    - ExecutionResult: sessionId, status, actions, finalResponse, totalTokens,
      totalCostUsd, durationMs, abortReason
    - ActionRecord: type (llm_call | tool_call), toolName, input, output,
      error, tokensUsed, costUsd, durationMs
    - SafetyLimits: maxActionsPerSession(20), maxTokensPerSession(100K),
      maxDurationMs(5min), maxConsecutiveErrors(3), toolCallMinIntervalMs(2s)

  packages/ai/src/engine/executor.ts — Core agentic loop:
    - Builds messages from context (merges to avoid consecutive user messages)
    - Calls Claude via callLLM with tool definitions from registry
    - Detects stop_reason: max_tokens → abort with "[Response truncated]"
    - Tool execution: Zod validation → approval check → rate limit (2s) →
      execute with 60s timeout (timer cleared with .finally())
    - Truncates tool results to 10K chars to prevent context window bloat
    - Failed LLM calls count toward action limit
    - Non-blocking action_logs persistence
    - Safety checks per iteration: action count, token budget, duration,
      consecutive errors
    - Ensures terminal status (completed | error | aborted) before returning

  packages/ai/src/tools/registry.ts:
    - ToolRegistry class: register, get, getAll, getByNames, toAnthropicTools
    - zodToJsonSchema + zodTypeToJsonSchema: hand-rolled converters for
      ZodString, ZodNumber, ZodBoolean, ZodOptional, ZodArray, ZodEnum, ZodObject
    - 3 stub tools:
      - get_current_time: returns ISO timestamp + timezone
      - search_company_memory: placeholder for vector search
      - log_message: structured JSON logging (prevents log injection)

  packages/ai/src/memory/individual.ts:
    - loadMemory(agentId, projectId): loads all key/value entries
    - saveMemory(agentId, projectId, key, value): race-safe upsert
      (try INSERT, catch duplicate → UPDATE fallback)
    - searchMemory(agentId, projectId, query, topK): stub returning all
      entries (TODO P1: vector similarity with pgvector)

  apps/worker/src/jobs/agent-execution.ts:
    - processAgentExecution(data): full agent execution handler
    - CAS concurrency guard: UPDATE agents SET status='working'
      WHERE id=agentId AND status='idle' (prevents parallel runs)
    - Loads agent config, memory, builds context, creates session
    - Configurable limits: maxActionsPerSession from agent config,
      token budget from cost budget × 100K
    - Sentry.captureException on failure with agentId/projectId/sessionId tags
    - Updates agent status to idle (success) or error (failure)

  packages/ai/src/index.ts:
    - Updated barrel exports for all engine components:
      executeAgent, AgentSession, AgentContext, ToolDefinition,
      ToolExecutionContext, ExecutionResult, ActionRecord, SafetyLimits,
      DEFAULT_SAFETY_LIMITS, toolRegistry, loadMemory, saveMemory, searchMemory

    packages/ai/src/index.ts (barrel exports)
    pnpm-lock.yaml

REVIEW — ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED BEFORE COMMIT:
  CRITICAL (3):
    1. Failed LLM calls did not increment actionCount → could infinite-loop
       on persistent API errors → Added session.actionCount++ in catch block
    2. Promise.race timer leaked on successful tool execution → clearTimeout
       never called → Added .finally(() => clearTimeout(timeoutId!))
    3. Unbounded tool result strings could fill context window → Added
       MAX_TOOL_RESULT_LENGTH (10K chars) truncation with "[truncated]" marker

  HIGH (5):
    4. Consecutive user messages would violate Anthropic API contract
       → Added merge logic: if last message is user role, concatenate content
    5. stop_reason: max_tokens treated as successful completion (silent
       truncation) → Detect stop_reason and abort with clear message
    6. No concurrency guard → agent could run multiple sessions in parallel
       → CAS: UPDATE WHERE status='idle', skip if already working
    7. requiresApproval tools created wasteful retry loop (never-ending
       tool call attempts) → Abort session with reason message for review
    8. Log injection via log_message tool → Structured JSON logging with
       JSON.stringify and message length limit (1000 chars)

  MEDIUM (9):
    9. safeStringify helper missing (JSON.stringify could throw on circular refs)
       → Added try/catch wrapper with String() fallback
    10. toolDef.execute called with raw input before Zod validation
        → Moved validation before execution, use parseResult.data
    11. Wrong duration calculated for error actions (used shared start time)
        → Per-call llmCallStart/toolStart timestamps
    12. Missing type narrowing on tool_use blocks → Added type predicate filter
    13. No rate limiting between tool calls → Added toolCallMinIntervalMs (2s)
    14. Worker imported from deep @ai-office/ai paths → Updated barrel exports
    15. zodToJsonSchema fragile (doesn't handle ZodDefault, ZodNullable, etc.)
        → Acknowledged: TODO replace with zod-to-json-schema library
    16. Anthropic Tool type mismatch in inline tool generation
        → Simplified to use registry.toAnthropicTools()
    17. triggerPayload could be huge → Sliced to 10K chars

VERIFICATION:
  - turbo typecheck --force: 8/8 packages pass, zero type errors
  - All safety limits enforced: actions, tokens, duration, errors, rate limit
  - Timer cleanup verified (no leaks in Promise.race)
  - CAS concurrency guard prevents parallel agent sessions
  - Tool results truncated to 10K chars
  - All 3 stub tools registered and functional

COMMIT #13 — Epic P0-8: Internationalization (next-intl)
================================================================================
Hash:     d9ee26e
Date:     2026-02-24 ~23:00 -0300
Tasks:    P0-8.1 through P0-8.4 (4 tasks)
================================================================================

WHAT WAS BUILT:
  apps/web/src/i18n/routing.ts:
    - defineRouting() with locales: ['pt-BR', 'en-US'], default: 'pt-BR'
    - Exported Locale type

  apps/web/src/i18n/request.ts:
    - getRequestConfig() for server components
    - Dynamic message import with try/catch fallback to default locale
    - Validates locale against routing.locales via hasLocale()

  apps/web/src/i18n/navigation.ts:
    - createNavigation(routing) → Link, redirect, usePathname, useRouter,
      getPathname (locale-aware navigation utilities)

  apps/web/src/middleware.ts:
    - Combined Clerk + next-intl middleware
    - intlMiddleware runs inside clerkMiddleware callback, returning the
      intl response for Clerk to decorate with auth headers
    - Public routes include bare and locale-prefixed sign-in/sign-up/root
    - API/webhook routes excluded from locale handling

  apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx:
    - Stripped to pass-through: renders only {children}
    - Imports globals.css (no <html>/<body> — those live in [locale] layout)

  apps/web/src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx:
    - Renders <html lang={locale}> with IBM Plex Mono font variable
    - ClerkProvider with locale-aware signInUrl, signUpUrl, afterSignOutUrl
    - NextIntlClientProvider with locale + messages
    - Validates locale via hasLocale(), calls notFound() on invalid
    - generateStaticParams() for SSG support
    - Metadata: title + description

  apps/web/src/app/[locale]/page.tsx:
    - Uses useTranslations('common') for localized content

  apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(public)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx:
    - Clerk SignIn with forceRedirectUrl={`/${locale}`}
    - Dark theme appearance overrides

  apps/web/src/app/not-found.tsx:
    - Root 404 page (outside locale segment, inline styles)

  apps/web/src/app/[locale]/not-found.tsx:
    - Locale-aware 404 page using translated strings

  apps/web/src/components/locale-switcher/locale-switcher.tsx:
    - Custom dropdown matching DOS design system
    - Uses routing.locales as source of truth (no duplication)
    - Runtime locale validation with fallback
    - ARIA attributes: aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, aria-label, role=listbox/option
    - Escape key to close, outside click to close
    - Emoji flags for PT-BR and EN-US

  apps/web/src/lib/formatters.ts:
    - formatDate(date, locale): dd/MM/yyyy (PT-BR) | MM/dd/yyyy (EN-US)
    - formatDateTime(date, locale): with time component
    - formatCurrency(amount, currency, locale): R$ 1.234,56 | $1,234.56
    - formatNumber(n, locale, options?): locale-aware number formatting
    - formatRelativeTime(date, locale): "há 2 horas" | "2 hours ago"

    apps/web/package.json (added next-intl)

  Moved:
    apps/web/src/app/page.tsx → apps/web/src/app/[locale]/page.tsx
    apps/web/src/app/(public)/ → apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(public)/

REVIEW — ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED BEFORE COMMIT:
  CRITICAL (2):
    1. Clerk sign-in/sign-up env vars pointed to bare /sign-in (no locale prefix)
       → Updated .env.example to /pt-BR/sign-in, passed signInUrl/signUpUrl
         dynamically to ClerkProvider based on current locale
    2. Middleware intl response could discard Clerk auth headers — intlMiddleware
       created new NextResponse after auth.protect() already ran
       → Return intlMiddleware(req) from clerkMiddleware callback so Clerk
         decorates the intl response with auth headers

  HIGH (3):
    3. <html> tag had no lang attribute — root layout rendered HTML shell without
       locale access → Moved <html>/<body> to [locale]/layout.tsx, root layout
       is now a pass-through that only renders {children}
    4. No not-found.tsx anywhere — notFound() call on invalid locale showed
       unstyled default 404 → Created both root and locale-aware 404 pages
    6. Sign-in/sign-up pages lacked forceRedirectUrl — Clerk redirected to
       bare / after auth → Added forceRedirectUrl={`/${locale}`} to both
       SignIn and SignUp components

  MEDIUM (3):
    7. Public routes missing /:locale root path → Added to matcher
    8. Unsafe type assertion useLocale() as Locale → Added runtime guard
       with fallback to defaultLocale
    9. Duplicated LOCALES array in LocaleSwitcher → Changed to use
       routing.locales as single source of truth

  LOW (3):
    11. Dynamic import without try/catch → Added fallback to default locale
    14. No generateStaticParams → Added for SSG support
    17. Missing ARIA attributes on LocaleSwitcher → Added aria-expanded,
        aria-haspopup, aria-label, role=listbox/option, Escape key handler

  ALSO FIXED DURING CODING:
    - packages/tsconfig/nextjs.json missing "dom" and "dom.iterable" lib entries
      (required for client component DOM APIs like document, Node, HTMLElement)

VERIFICATION:
  - turbo typecheck --force: 8/8 packages pass, zero type errors
  - All pages moved under [locale] dynamic segment
  - <html lang={locale}> renders with correct locale
  - 117 translation keys across 8 namespaces in both locales
  - Formatters use Intl API for locale-aware date/number/currency
  - ClerkProvider receives locale-aware URLs

COMMIT #15 — Epic P0-9: tRPC Router & Socket.IO
================================================================================
Hash:     dd5f66d
Date:     2026-02-24 ~24:00 -0300
Tasks:    P0-9.1 through P0-9.5 (5 tasks)
================================================================================

WHAT WAS BUILT:
  apps/web/src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts:
    - tRPC v11 fetch handler for Next.js App Router
    - createTRPCContext with Clerk auth() userId
    - x-project-id header forwarded to context
    - Exports GET + POST handlers

  apps/web/src/lib/trpc/client.ts:
    - createTRPCReact<AppRouter>() with explicit ReturnType annotation
      (fixes TS2742 non-portable inferred type error)

  apps/web/src/lib/trpc/server.ts:
    - Server-side caller for RSC: appRouter.createCaller(ctx)
    - Cached via React.cache() to deduplicate within single request
    - Reads x-project-id from headers()

  apps/web/src/lib/trpc/provider.tsx:
    - TRPCProvider wrapping children with QueryClientProvider
    - httpBatchLink with superjson transformer
    - Reads projectId from Zustand localStorage (JSON.parse in try/catch)
    - staleTime: 30s, refetchOnWindowFocus: false

  packages/api/src/root.ts:
    - Merges 7 domain routers: agents, projects, actionLogs, approvals,
      workflows, strategies, users
    - Exports AppRouter type + appRouter instance

  packages/api/src/routers/agents.ts:
    - list, getById, create, update, delete, updateStatus, trigger
    - All scoped to ctx.project via projectProcedure/adminProcedure
    - trigger uses adminProcedure (prevents unauthorized agent execution)

  packages/api/src/routers/projects.ts:
    - list (by org), getById, create, update
    - Scoped to ctx.org via protectedProcedure

  packages/api/src/routers/action-logs.ts:
    - list (paginated with cursor, type/agentId/date filters)
    - getById
    - Uses gte/lte from drizzle-orm for date range filtering

  packages/api/src/routers/approvals.ts:
    - listPending, approve, reject
    - approve/reject use adminProcedure with reviewer tracking

  packages/api/src/routers/workflows.ts:
    - list, getById, create, update, delete, trigger
    - trigger creates workflow_runs row (adminProcedure)

  packages/api/src/routers/strategies.ts:
    - list, getById, create, update, refineWithAI, addLearning
    - addLearning uses adminProcedure (fixed from projectProcedure)
    - confidence field: number→String() for numeric DB column
    - refineWithAI: stub returning {enqueued: true} (TODO: BullMQ job)

  packages/api/src/routers/users.ts:
    - getCurrent, updateLocale, updateTimezone
    - protectedProcedure (any authenticated user can update own settings)

  packages/api/src/trpc.ts:
    - Added AuthUser, AuthOrg, AuthProject narrowed types
    - enforceAuth/enforceProject assign typed local vars before next()
    - Note: tRPC v11 doesn't propagate narrowed types through chained
      .use() middleware — routers use non-null assertions (!) as pragmatic
      workaround (runtime safety guaranteed by middleware)

  apps/worker/src/socket/server.ts:
    - Socket.IO server attached to worker HTTP server
    - JWT verified via @clerk/backend verifyToken() (not base64 decode)
    - User lookup after auth to get orgId + role for authorization
    - subscribe:project: verifies project belongs to user's org via DB query
    - trigger:agent: requires admin+ role (ROLE_HIERARCHY check)
    - CORS: explicit origin allowlist (localhost:3000/3001 + WEB_URL env)
    - emitToProject(): typed helper for broadcasting to project rooms

  packages/realtime/src/events.ts:
    - 12 server→client events: agent:status_changed, agent:action,
      agent:session_started, agent:session_complete, agent:error,
      approval:requested, approval:resolved, workflow:started,
      workflow:node_complete, workflow:complete, kpi:updated, learning:new
    - 2 client→server events: subscribe:project, trigger:agent
    - Typed interfaces for all event payloads
    - SERVER_EVENTS and CLIENT_EVENTS const maps

  apps/web/src/hooks/use-socket.ts:
    - useSocket(projectId): global singleton with Clerk auth token
    - Reference counting for cleanup (disconnect when count reaches 0)
    - Reconnection: 5 attempts, 1s delay, websocket+polling
    - useSocketEvent(event, handler): subscribes to typed events
    - Handles race condition: polls for socket if not yet connected
    - Re-subscribes on reconnect to catch missed events

    packages/api/src/trpc.ts (narrowed types, typed locals)
    packages/realtime/src/index.ts (barrel exports for events)

    apps/worker/src/index.ts (Socket.IO server creation)

    pnpm-lock.yaml

REVIEW — ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED BEFORE COMMIT:
  CRITICAL (3):
    1. Socket.IO JWT not verified — just base64 decoded without signature check
       → Installed @clerk/backend, replaced with verifyToken() using
         CLERK_SECRET_KEY (fails on expired/tampered tokens)
    2. No project authorization on subscribe:project — any authenticated user
       could subscribe to any project room (cross-tenant data leak)
       → Added DB query: verify project.orgId matches socket.data.orgId
    3. No authorization on trigger:agent — any user could trigger agent execution
       → Added ROLE_HIERARCHY check requiring admin+ role

  HIGH (5):
    4. CORS origin undefined in production — process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL
       gate was inverted, production would have undefined origin
       → Changed to explicit getAllowedOrigins() returning localhost + WEB_URL
    5. JSON.parse in provider.tsx could throw on corrupted localStorage,
       crashing all tRPC requests → Wrapped in try/catch with fallback
    6. Socket never disconnects — components unmount but global socket stays open
       with stale auth tokens → Added reference counting, disconnect when count=0
    7. useSocketEvent misses events if socket not yet connected (race condition)
       → Added polling interval + re-subscribe on reconnect event
    8. strategies.addLearning used projectProcedure (any project member could add)
       → Changed to adminProcedure

  ALSO FIXED:
    - ZodSchema<T> in createTypedWorker didn't accept schemas with .default()
      (input type differs from output type) → Changed to ZodType<T, ZodTypeDef, unknown>
    - tRPC v11 middleware type narrowing: chained .use() doesn't propagate
      NonNullable types → Pragmatic solution: non-null assertions (!) in routers
    - socket.io-client generic type complexity → Minimal any casts on .on/.off
    - createCallerFactory not exported from @trpc/server → Used appRouter.createCaller()
    - TS2742 non-portable inferred type → Explicit ReturnType annotation on trpc client
    - strategies confidence: number input vs string DB column → String(confidence)

VERIFICATION:
  - turbo typecheck --force: 8/8 packages pass, zero type errors
  - JWT verified with @clerk/backend verifyToken (cryptographic check)
  - Project access verified via DB query (org isolation)
  - Agent trigger requires admin+ role
  - Socket cleanup on unmount (reference counting)
  - 7 domain routers covering all 15 DB tables
  - 14 typed Socket.IO events with const maps

COMMIT #17 — Epic P0-10: UI Shell & Base Layout
================================================================================
Hash:     dd1863f
Date:     2026-02-25 ~01:00 -0300
Tasks:    P0-10.1 through P0-10.5 (5 tasks)
================================================================================

WHAT WAS BUILT:
  apps/web/src/components/ui/:
    - Button: primary/secondary/ghost/danger variants, sm/md/lg sizes
    - Input: dark theme, focus ring, disabled state
    - Skeleton: animated pulse placeholder
    - Tooltip: hover + focus/blur (keyboard accessible), delayed show (200ms),
      timeout cleared on unmount, 4 position sides, useId for a11y
    - Separator: horizontal/vertical with aria-orientation
    - Badge: default/warning/success/error/cyan variants
    - index.ts barrel export

  apps/web/src/stores/ui-store.ts:
    - Zustand store for sidebarCollapsed + railCollapsed
    - persist middleware with partialize (only data, no functions)
    - skipHydration: true (rehydrated in AppShell useEffect)

  apps/web/src/components/layout/app-shell.tsx:
    - AppShell: flex layout with ProjectRail + RailExpandButton + Sidebar +
      Header + main content area
    - Rehydrates both project-store and ui-store on client mount

  apps/web/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx:
    - 11 nav items with lucide-react icons
    - Items: Office, ATLAS*, Agents, Workflows*, DevOps*, Approvals (badge),
      Strategy*, Memory, Tools, Analytics*, Settings (*=Coming Soon)
    - Collapsed mode: 52px with Tooltip on each item
    - Expanded mode: 220px with label + badges
    - Uses CSS custom properties for widths (--width-sidebar-*)
    - Active route: cyan left border + bg-overlay highlight
    - i18n labels via useTranslations('nav')
    - aria-label on <nav> element
    - Collapse/expand toggle button with ChevronLeft/ChevronRight

  apps/web/src/components/layout/project-rail.tsx:
    - ProjectRail: colored project squares from Zustand store
    - Active project: color border + left indicator bar
    - Tooltip on each project icon (hover + focus)
    - "+" button for new project
    - Collapsed by default (width: 0, overflow: hidden)
    - RailExpandButton: separate component visible when collapsed
    - project.color sanitized via safeColor() hex validation
    - Collapse toggle only rendered when expanded (not clipped by overflow)

  apps/web/src/components/layout/header.tsx:
    - Breadcrumb: project name (colored) / page name (from route)
    - Search stub: Cmd+K (Mac) / Ctrl+K (Win/Linux), platform detected via useEffect
    - Notification bell with pulse indicator for pending approvals
    - LocaleSwitcher (existing component)
    - Company/Project switcher dropdown:
      - Lists all projects with colored squares
      - "ativo"/"active" indicator on current project
      - Outside click + Escape key to close
      - ARIA: aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, role=listbox, role=option
    - Clerk UserButton with 24px avatar

  apps/web/src/lib/safe-color.ts:
    - safeColor(color): validates hex pattern /^#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}$/
    - Returns fallback #6E7681 on invalid input (prevents CSS injection)

  apps/web/src/components/shared/coming-soon.tsx:
    - Placeholder component for feature-flagged routes
    - Shows Construction icon + translated title + "Coming Soon" badge

  apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(auth)/layout.tsx:
    - Auth layout wrapping children with AppShell

  apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(auth)/*/page.tsx:
    - 11 route pages: office, atlas, agents, workflows, devops, approvals,
      strategy, memory, tools, analytics, settings
    - Active routes: placeholder with translated title
    - Coming-soon routes: ComingSoon component

  apps/web/src/app/[locale]/page.tsx:
    - Root page redirects to /{locale}/office

  apps/web/messages/pt-BR.json + en-US.json:
    - Added 10 new nav keys: atlas, devops, memory, tools, comingSoon,
      companies, newProject, active, collapseNav, expandNav,
      searchPlaceholder, notifications

REVIEW — ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED BEFORE COMMIT:
  HIGH (7):
    1. Tooltip: setTimeout not cleared on unmount (memory leak)
       → Added cleanup useEffect
    2. Tooltip: inaccessible to keyboard users (no focus/blur)
       → Added onFocus/onBlur handlers, useId for ARIA
    3. project.color used directly in inline styles (CSS injection risk)
       → Created safeColor() with hex regex validation + fallback
    4. Header project dropdown: no Escape key handling
       → Added keydown listener for Escape alongside mousedown
    5. ui-store: persist serialized functions to localStorage
       → Added partialize to only persist data fields
    6. Sidebar: React key on wrong element in .map()
       → Moved key to outermost wrapper in both branches
    7. Header: search shortcut hardcodes macOS ⌘ glyph
       → Added platform detection useEffect, shows Ctrl+K on Win/Linux

  MEDIUM (5):
    8. Project rail toggle: icon didn't change based on state
       → Only render toggle when expanded, RailExpandButton handles collapsed
    9. Project rail toggle: clipped by overflow:hidden when collapsed
       → Conditionally render with {!collapsed && ...}
    10. RailExpandButton: missing aria-label
        → Added translated aria-label
    12. Sidebar <nav>: missing aria-label landmark
        → Added aria-label="Main navigation"
    14. Separator: missing aria-orientation
        → Added aria-orientation={orientation}

VERIFICATION:
  - turbo typecheck --force: 8/8 packages pass, zero type errors
  - 11 routes under (auth) group with AppShell wrapper
  - Sidebar: 11 nav items, 5 with "Coming Soon" badge
  - All project colors sanitized before inline style injection
  - Tooltip accessible via keyboard (focus/blur + hover)
  - Escape key closes dropdowns (header project switcher)
  - Platform-aware keyboard shortcut display
